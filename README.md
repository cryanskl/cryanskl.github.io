# 🌌 Forked from "Theory of Everything" by Huanyu Shi

This project is a **fork** of [Huanyu Shi's amazing personal site](https://huanyushi.github.io/), built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the beautifully crafted [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme.

## ✨ About This Fork

I've made some minor changes based on the original project to suit my personal preferences or experimental needs.  
All credit goes to **Huanyu Shi** for his detailed customizations and excellent documentation!
